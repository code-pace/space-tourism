### What I learned

During the course of building this space tourism web pages, I learn't that state management is indeed a required process of organizing data in react, it was not strictly implemented in this project as I have drafted it out for future learning ðŸ˜ž, secondly learnt intensively react-router-dom in accordance with the new update on it's current version.

### Useful resources

This time around, I decided to write a google free react app practice, though references to my notes where made ðŸ¤ª.
